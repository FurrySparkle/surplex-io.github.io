This doc will guide you through setting up the Wi-Fi connection of your Surplex Shoes. 

Our shoes use Wi-Fi for data transmission. Hence, you would need a router in your house with good signal quality. (at least within the room you intended to use Surplex shoes)

Firstly, please check your currently connected network information on the computer with which you intend to use Surplex's shoes. Having your computer connected to the router through a cable is suggested to ensure a robust connection. You will need your router's:

1. SSID (e.g., TP-LINK3592)
2. Password
3. Currently connected IPv4 ([Tutorial here]) Address on your router. (e.g., 192.168.1.120)

<!-- A paragraph -->
If you are using Wi-Fi (i.e., not cable) on your computer, It's suggested to [manually] fix your IPv4 address network setting on your computer. Otherwise, you will need to manually edit the IPv4 address every time you change your IPv4 address within your home router. That can happen if, for example, other people take your IPv4 address. 


Once you have the abovementioned information. Please head over to Surplex's [firmware] site and download Surplex's firmware code and upload it to your Surplex's shoes.
